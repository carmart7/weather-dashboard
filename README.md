# weather-dashboard

## Description

This site hosts a work day scheduler for the user to save tasks for each hour of the most common business day hours. It's built with html, css, and jss with a focus on displaying the ability to use multiple third party API's to design the page, modify the page, and get information such as current day to be placed on the page.

This site hosts a weather dashboard that allows the user to enter any city name and a set of cards will display the current weather in that city with a 5 day forecast. Within those cards a user can find an icon to represent the weather along with information on the temperate, humidity, and wind speeds. Information for weather is gathered from the open weather API listed below.
